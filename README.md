# Stackrox development environment

[![](http://github-actions.40ants.com/stehessel/stackrox-env/matrix.svg)](https://github.com/stehessel/stackrox-env)

Isolated and reproducible development environment for the Stackrox stack using Nix flakes.

## Environment

Compilers / runtimes:

* `golang 1.17.x`
* `openjdk 11`
* `python 3.9`

Libraries:

* `rocksdb 6.15.5`

Applications:

* `bats`
* `gcc`
* `gcloud`
* `gradle`
* `helm`
* `jq`
* `kubectl`
* `kubectx`
* `make`
* `nodejs`
* OpenShift Client `oc`
* OpenShift Cluster Manager Client `ocm`
* `wget`
* `yarn`
* `yq`

## Prerequisites

- Install `Nix` by following the [instructions](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/installation/installing-binary.html)
  based on your platform.
- **(Optional)** Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:stehessel/stackrox-env.git ~/dev/nix/stackrox`.

## Usage

### Ad-hoc shell

Run `nix --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" develop github:stehessel/stackrox-env -c $SHELL` to open a shell
with the development environment based on the latest upstream state. Alternatively, open a shell based on a local clone
of the repository `nix --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" develop ~/dev/nix/stackrox -c $SHELL`. This allows
for more fine grained control, but requires manual updates from time to time by pulling the latest master.

### Login shell

You may choose to load the development environment inside the login shell. This effectively means that the development
environment will be available in every shell, which is convenient when no other environments are used anyway. Modifying
the login shell is recommended when working with graphical IDEs such as GoLand and VSCode.

- Clone the repository as outlined above.
- Add `source ~/dev/nix/stackrox/login.sh` to either `~/.bash_profile.sh` (bash) or `~/.zprofile` (zsh).

Note you should source `login.sh` after the lines added by the Nix installer, but before setting up the Stackrox workflow
tools (if you use them) via

```sh
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
source "$HOME/go/src/github.com/stackrox/workflow/env.sh"
```

### Direnv integration

`Direnv` allows you to automatically modify the shell environment when entering a directory. This can be used to load the
development environment upon entering the `stackrox/stackrox` repository. It is the recommended usage when working primarily
from the command line.

- Install [Direnv with Nix flake integration](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv).
- Create a `.envrc` file inside the `stackrox/stackrox` directory and add `use flake github:stehessel/stackrox-env` to it.
  Alternatively, add `use flake ~/dev/nix/stackrox/` to use a local clone of the repository.

## Platforms

The Nix flake is tested via continuous integration on Linux and macOS (Intel). Unfortunately, GitHub does not provide
macOS ARM runners, but the flake should build on M1 machines as well. If not, please let me know.

## Caveats

Loading the development environment inserts the `Nix` binaries at the beginning of `$PATH`.
If `$PATH` is later overwritten by another process, the isolation breaks and global version
of binaries could be first in `$PATH`.

I have not included `docker` in the build environment because at least on macOS `Docker Desktop`
is not open sourced.
